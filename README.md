# HTML Preview with Bootstrap and jQuery

## Features

Preview HTML snippets with Bootstrap and jQuery directly in VS Code. This extension provides a live preview of your HTML content with your selected versions of Bootstrap and jQuery included.

I use this for helping me write Knowledge Base articles in ServiceNow using [SNUtils and SN-Scriptsync](https://www.arnoudkooi.com) but I'm sure there are many other use cases!

Choose from a wide range of versions:
* Bootstrap: versions 3.1.1 through 5.3.3
* jQuery: versions 1.5.1 through 3.7.1

## Instructions

There are two ways to open the preview:

1. With an HTML file open, click the preview icon in the editor title bar (appears in the top-right corner when viewing HTML files).
2. With an HTML file open, open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and search for "HTML Preview with Bootstrap and jQuery".

## Configuration

You can customize which versions of Bootstrap and jQuery are used in the preview:

1. Open VS Code Settings (File > Preferences > Settings or Ctrl+,)
2. Search for "HTML Preview with Bootstrap and jQuery"
3. Select your preferred versions from the dropdown menus

Default versions:
* Bootstrap: 3.4.1
* jQuery: 2.2.4

Note: If you change the versions of Bootstrap or jQuery in the extension settings, close and reopen the preview for the changes to take effect.

## Release Notes

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

**Enjoy!**
