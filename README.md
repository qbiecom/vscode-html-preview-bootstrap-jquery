# HTML Preview with Bootstrap and jQuery

## Features

Preview a HTML snippet with Bootstrap and jQuery.

I use this for helping me write Knowledge Base articles in ServiceNow using [SNUtils and SN-Scriptsync](https://www.arnoudkooi.com) but I'm sure there are many other use cases!

Choose from:
* Bootstrap 3, 4, 5
* jQuery 1, 2, 3

## Instructions

With a HTML file open, open the command palette and search for 'HTML Preview with Bootstrap and jQuery' to open the preview.

If you change the version sof Bootstrap or jQuery in the extension settings, close and reopen the preview for this to take effect.

## Release Notes

* 1.1.1 - Updated readme
* 1.1.0 - Choose which versions of libraries to include from the extension settings
* 1.0.0 - Initial Release, only supports Bootstrap 3 and jQuery 2

**Enjoy!**
